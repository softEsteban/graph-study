## Graph Practice

In this practice, we explore various graph algorithms. This is a full course provided by freeCodeCamp.

### Basic Concepts

- Graph: A graph is composed of nodes and edges.
- Nodes: These are objects that contain data.
- Edges: Connections between nodes, also known as vertices.
- Adjacency List: It is a programmatic way to represent graphs.

For example:

```javascript
{
    a: [b, c],
    b: [d],
    c: [e],
    d: [],
    e: [b],
    f: [d]
}
```

### Algorithms

1. Depth-First Search (DFS) Stack

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Queue
